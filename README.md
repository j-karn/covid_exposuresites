# COVID Exposure sites
A self-led project to learn how to work with a different data format, json, and try out mapbox when visualising exposure sites.

The data is for locations associated with confirmed COVID-19 cases that have been classified by NSW Health for action. The data is updated daily. Locations are removed when 14 days have passed since the last known date that a confirmed case was associated with the location.
